# Description

Our program generates a random map once executed, the ground tiles are fully extendable and can be weighted to allow for more or less likely spawns of that type. After the base map is generated we create seas and beaches over the top using another array. We have added the temporary ability to scroll around the map by tapping the arrow keys.
